Tobacco is a product prepared from the leaves of the tobacco plant by curing them. The plant is part of the genus Nicotiana and of the Solanaceae (nightshade) family. While more than 70 species of tobacco are known, the chief commercial crop is N. tabacum. The more potent variant N. rustica is also used around the world.

Tobacco contains the alkaloid nicotine, which is a stimulant, and harmala alkaloids.[2] Dried tobacco leaves are mainly used for smoking in cigarettes, cigars, pipe tobacco, and flavored shisha tobacco. They can also be consumed as snuff, chewing tobacco, dipping tobacco and snus.</br>

<b><ins>Ecological Requirement for Tobacco Cultivation</b></ins>

<b>A) Climatic Requirement for Tobacco Cultivation:</b>

1. Basically tobacco is a semi tropical crop but can be successfully grown in tropical region.
2. It requires 210C to 310C temperature during growth period.
3. An annual rainfall requirement is 500 to 1,250 mm.
4. It cannot tolerate high speed winds and storms during growth period.
5. Frost conditions during maturity are harmful.
6. N. rustica requires cooler climate as compared to N. tabacum.

<b>B) Soil Requirement for Tobacco Cultivation:</b>

1. Tobacco crop requires light to medium loam soil which is poor in humus content but better in potash, phosphoric acid and iron.
2. Soil rich in humus and nitrogen gives more yield but the quality of tobacco is poor due to its objectionable smoke.
3. Heavy soil and water logged soil is unsuitable for tobacco crop.
