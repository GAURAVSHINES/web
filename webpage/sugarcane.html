Sugarcane, or sugar cane, are several species of tall perennial true grasses of the genus Saccharum, tribe Andropogoneae, native to the warm temperate to tropical regions of South Asia and Melanesia, and used for sugar production. It has stout, jointed, fibrous stalks that are rich in the sugar sucrose, which accumulates in the stalk internodes. The plant is two to six meters (six to twenty feet) tall. All sugar cane species interbreed and the major commercial cultivars are complex hybrids[1]. Sugarcane belongs to the grass family Poaceae, an economically important seed plant family that includes maize, wheat, rice, and sorghum, and many forage crops.</br>

<b>Climatic Condition for Sugarcane</b>

India is the largest sugarcane producing state in the world though her per-hectare production is lower than Cuba. Sugar cane is a product of the tropical or Sub-tropical countries and temperate lands. The climatic conditions for Sugarcane is mentioned below.

<b>Temperature:</b>
 The ideal temperature for the cultivation of sugarcane is 27Â°Celsius.

<b>Rainfall:</b> 
100 cm to 175 cm rainfall is ideal for sugarcane production. In tropical and sub-tropical or regions sugarcane is grown abundantly due to the lengthening of the period of rainy season. Frost is injurious to sugarcane. It can be grown nicely on sea coast as salty wind is good for its fertility for the cultivation of the crop.

<b>Soil:</b>
Loamy fertile soil mixed with salt and lime is good for sugarcane production.

<b>Land: </b>
Plain land or gentle slope is ideal for sugarcane cultivation. Uttar Pradesh is the largest producer of sugarcane in India, followed by Punjab, Haryana, Bihar, Maharashtra, Andhra Pradesh and Tamil Nadu.
